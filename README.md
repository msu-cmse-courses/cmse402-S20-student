# CMSE 402, "Data Visualization Principles and Techniques"

This is the **student Git repository** for CMSE 402. It contains the core materials for the course. This includes (in various directories):

* course_documents/ -- logistical documents like the syllabus and the course calendar
* readings/ -- readings for the course (these will also be available with the appropriate assignments)
* project/ -- semester project information

This repository may be updated as the course progresses.

The course website can be accessed here: https://msu-cmse-courses.github.io/cmse402-S20-student/

Note that many documents in this repository use Markdown as a formatting language, see https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax or https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet for more information and instructions on how to use this. You can read this easily with any text editor, but for proper formatting you should look at it with a Markdown editor (e.g., MacDown for OS X: https://macdown.uranusjr.com/).
