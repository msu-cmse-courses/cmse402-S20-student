# CMSE 402 Coding Standards

This document contains the coding standards for this course.  The
purpose of these standards is to create Python code and documentation
that is well-structured and easy to understand, which will help with
the debugging, testing, and maintenance of your code.  These standards
are based on those for CSE-231 [1], but modified somewhat to reflect
the needs of this class.  As with the CSE-231 coding standards, not
all situations are covered - in that case, we refer the interested
student to the extensive style guide written by Guido van Rossum, the
creater of Python [2].

## Overriding principle for this coding standard

Write and document your code so that it is easy to
read and easy to understand.  This is critical in the era of
open-source scientific software - it helps others use (and reuse) your
code, and it also helps YOU do the same when you return to your code
months after you've last looked at it. If you've ever had to use someone
else's code, you know how hard it can be to make sense of things. Don't
make someone else feel the same way about your code in the future!

---

## Source code format

Source code lines should be short enough to not wrap or be partially
hidden on a typical editor screen -- in general, this means no more
than 70-80 characters per line.  Break long lines into shorter lines
using the continuation character (`\`).

Only one statement should be included on a given line of source code -
do not put multiple statements in a single line!

Use blank spaces and blank lines to enhance readability of both source
statements and comments.  Note that it's possible to have too much
whitespace, which decreases readability of the code - consult
reference [2] to see some examples.

Use four spaces for indentation - do NOT use tabs.  You can typically
get your editor (emacs, vi, nano) to use spaces instead of tabs -
consult Google for instructions.

Control structures should not be nested too deeply.  If the clarity of
the source code is impaired by too many levels of nesting, the
statements that are nested most deeply should be removed and placed in
a separate function.

Individual functions should not be excessively long (many hundreds of
lines or more) to promote clarity.  Break long functions up into
smaller functions whenever possible (but not to the point where
clarity is lost).

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Naming conventions

All functions, variables, and classes should have names that clearly
describe their purpose and that are not duplicated (i.e., a name
should be used for only one purpose, and not for both a variable AND a
function).

Variables should be named with the "lower with under" style -
lower-case letters with underscores between words.  For example,
```car_count``` is an appropriate name.  When variables are defined, a
brief comment should be added explaining what the variable does.  For
example:

```
   car_count = 0    #  keeps track of cars entering intersection
```

Symbolic constants (e.g., physical constants and other constants)
should be used instead of embedding arbitrary constants in the source
code.  Use the same convention as variables, but use all caps.  For
example:

```
    BOLTZMANN_CONSTANT = 1.38e-23  # Boltzmann's constant in Joules/Kelvin
```

and then statements using it would look like this:

```
    energy = BOLTZMANN_CONSTANT * my_temp 
```

Function definitions should use the same naming convention as
variables (the "lower with under" style).

Class names should use the "CamelCase" style:

```
    class RocketShipEngine
```

-----------------------------------------------------------

## Descriptive comments

Your source code must include comments that describe the functionality
of all classes, functions, and significant blocks of code.  Not every
line must be commented, but any block of code that does something
substantial (significant data or file manipulation, error processing,
etc.) must be commented.  Note that comments should typically be just
before the code in question, and not appended after the end of the
line of code unless the comment is VERY short.

Every source code file must include an introductory block of comments
that describes the contents of the file and gives a brief overview of
what the contents do.  This should be done using the Python quote
block method (triple quotes).

For example:

```
"""
    File contains functions for unit conversion

    This includes the following routines:
       cm_to_parsecs, which converts centimeters to parsecs
       oz_to_solar_masses, which converts ounces to solar masses
       sec_to_millennium, which converts seconds to millennia

"""
```

Every function should use docstrings (delimited by triple
double-quotes) and must including an introductory block of comments
that explains the purpose of the function and describes all
information passed to the function and returned by it, including
parameters and data objects.  For example:

```
def count_cars( intersection_number, start_time, stop_time ):
    """
   Counts the number of cars passing through an intersection. 

   Receive: an integer describing the intersection number
     (intersection_number), as well as the floating-point times to
     start and stop counting (start_time, stop_time)
   Return: the number of cars that pass through the intersection in
     that time (an integer).  
   """
```
